## Intsall Required Package with conda
1. To switch to the path of the file, you can use the `cd` command in the terminal. For example, if the download path of the file is `~/desktop/online_inventory`, you can run the command `cd ~/desktop/online_inventory` in the terminal to switch to that directory.

2. If you’re using a PC, you can create a virtual environment named `NV` and install the required dependencies using the command `conda create –name NV –file requirements/requirements.txt`.

3. Once the virtual environment is created, you can activate it using the command `conda activate env_online`.

4. Finally, you can run the `main.py` file using the command `python main.py` while the virtual environment is activated.

5. If you don’t have Conda installed on your computer, you can refer to the instructions on how to [intsall Miniforge](https://equatorial-marlin-edd.notion.site/Install-Miniforge-on-Mac-of-M-chips-Windows-ec7d87d8c6494cca83681c5cbf9a3ac4).
