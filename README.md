1. To switch to the path of the file, you can use the `cd` command in the terminal. For example, if the download path of the file is `~/desktop/online_inventory`, you can run the command `cd ~/desktop/online_inventory` in the terminal to switch to that directory.

2. If you’re using a PC, you can create a virtual environment named `env_online` and install the required dependencies using the command `conda create –name env_online –file requirements/requirements.txt`.

3. Once the virtual environment is created, you can activate it using the command `conda activate env_online`.

4. Finally, you can run the `main.py` file using the command `python main.py` while the virtual environment is activated.
